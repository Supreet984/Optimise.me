# Code-Optimization
This repository is created to focus on code optimization. Today in the world of programming, where everywhere - everything is getting coded. It is very important to write optimized code. We need to focus on various complexities involved.


<b>I will update the readme.md file soon. Till then you can work on the issues if you wishes to. </b>

<h3> Research Papers</h3>
This folder contains all the available links of research paper for a particular optimization algorithm. 
Format of including Research Paper 
Consider one Optimization Technique and include as many research paper links as you can find and include them year wise. 
If you are working for Swarm Optimization Technique, open 2019, write its name and link and do the same for other years as well. If in case you do not find any links, still write the name of the technique and mention NONE under it. This will make it easy to access for everyone. The sequence would thus be maintained for it.
